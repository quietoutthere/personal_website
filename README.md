This is my first project that I created using HTML and CSS

Hello and thank you for taking the time to look at my project! A couple months ago I decided to take the plunge and fully commit to being a fullstack developer. 
There was some fear and trepidation involved in this process, but I decided to trust my work ethic and attitude and go for it.

This site is the beginning stages of my journey and I hope you follow along in my adventure!
